# SimpleSwiftUIExample

The idea of this repository is just play with SwiftUI. Then, I started to create an application to show different basketball leagues, teams and players.

### UI Components
Inside of the basketball app I have used the following components:
- Tables
- Collections
- Tabbed navigators
- Images
- Maps

Also, I have created many reusable views and have used ObjectBinding, EnvironmentObject, State, UIViewRepresentable, propertyWrapper, etc.

### App Features

Shows a list of leagues
Shows team detail
Shows list of favorite teams and favorite players
Add a team/player like favorite
Remove a team/player like favorite
